# Eat Prey Lock
### The Problem
The üêà keeps bringing in prey to the house through the cat flap, sometimes up to four times a day!  
This is in spite of being well fed, played with, having a bell and being kept in at night.  
He just likes killing things!!!

### Solution
Build a smart AI enabled cat flap that can detect if the cat has a mouse and lock for 5 minutes if so.  
It should also send an alert notification so any prey that's still alive can be rescued!

This will involve the following phases:
1. Building a motion sensor camera and streaming cat videos to carbon neutral cloud storage.
2. Training a neural network to recognise when the cat has prey.
3. Deploying the model "at the edge".
4. Building alert notification function.
5. Integrating with cat flap.
